    \section{Introduction}
      Many organizations offer a service and/or a product, this is how they function to acquire profit to sustain their business model. If the organization is providing a product, there are situations in which it might require assembly. Depending on the organization's procedure there might be numerous steps involved in the construction of the product. In addition, there could also be regulations and external procedures to apply.

      The following is a brief example, of some steps that might be involved in the assembly of a product:

      \startitemize
        \item Assembling a sub-component of the product.
        \item Notifying a department about the progress or milestones.
        \item Updating the inventory on needed/used materials.
        \item Safety regulations that must be taken before a specific step.
        \item Etc.
      \stopitemize

      Existing tools exist to assist in the management of steps as well as presentation of information on the workflow of products. With the rise of mobile slate devices, it is now possible to convey all this information onto a mobile platform. These mobile platforms would excel in varies situations as they are not restricted to a single fixed location. The goal is to provide an intuitive and secure mobile application that will enable users to remain informed about the assembly of products.

    \section{Product Vision/Scope}
      \subsection{Product Vision Statement}
        The mobile slate application will aid in organizational workflows so that users are aware of steps in a visual format to boost productivity and managerial organization.

      \subsection{Major Features}
        The mobile application will:

        \startitemize
          \item Interface with a database containing data on the workflows.
          \item Provide an intuitive interface to present visual workflow instructions.
          \item Ensure privacy and security of sensitive information.
          \item Keep track of schedule, inventory and progress.
          \item Make use of mobile wireless technology.
        \stopitemize

      \subsection{Project Scope}
        The mobile application will only be designed and limited to simple prototypes.  The user interface will be designed and fully prototyped (paper or slideshow) to allow for simple interactions. A database schema will be designed so that the mobile application can make proper use of database technologies. Basic functionality will be provided so that the mobile application matches the web interface.

    \section{Target Markets}
      The mobile application is targeted towards organizations that have procedures in place for various workflows. The primary target organization is one with products that must be assembled by following certain steps. The mobile application caters to organizations that require increased flexibility in mobility, to enable the instructions to be followed at any location.

    \section{Stakeholders}
      \subsection{Nessis}
        \subsubsection{Who are they?}
          The company that will develop this application. Nessis provides the framework to allow for custom visual workflow instructions (VWI). The targeted consumers are organizations that aim to document and provide a workflow to their procedures. These workflows are not limited to text and includes other media formats such as images and videos. Procedures are also not limited to only assembly procedures, but also to regulations and standard operating functions.

        \subsubsection{Why?}
          Nessis is the company leading the development of the mobile application and thus a direct stakeholder to this project.

      \subsection{Organizations/Content Creators}
        \subsubsection{Who are they?}
          Any organizations that wishes to use the VWI system to provide information to workers. The organizations might create the VWI content, or possibly an external source would be creating the content.

        \subsubsection{Why?}
          The mobile application will provide increased productivity and structure to operating procedures and/or regulations.

      \subsection{VWI Users}
        \subsubsection{Who are they?}
          Any user of the mobile application that is following a set of VWI.

        \subsubsection{Why?}
          These users are interacting with the mobile device and thus would be concerned with the interface and features of the application.

    \section{Assumptions}
      \startitemize
        \item VWI workers will have access to mobile platforms.
        \item An existing database that contains all the VWIs exists.
        \item The existing database is accessible via the Internet.
        \item The mobile application will be compliant with Nessis.
      \stopitemize

    \section{Constraints}
      \startitemize
        \item The software specification will be completed by March 1st.
        \item The design will be built on top of the Android operating system.
        \item The device to host the application must support all functionality of the application.
      \stopitemize

    \section{Business Requirements}
      \startitemize
        \item The application must be able to display VWIs.
        \item The application must be able to aid users in the constructions of products and the following of procedures.
        \item The application must increase the productivity of users and companies.
        \item The application must increase the efficiency of users and companies.
        \item The application must increase the quality of users and companies.
      \stopitemize
